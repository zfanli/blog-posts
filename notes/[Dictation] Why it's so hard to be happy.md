A long time ago, humanity rose to become the dominant species on planet earth, and we were able to do this because of one specific trait. It certainly wasn't our physical prowess, pretty much any animal the same size as us would absolutely destroy us in a one-on-one physical altercation. And it wasn't even our ability to use tools because that's not unique to humans.

人类在很久以前就成为了地球上的支配者物种，让我们可以做到这一点的是我们身上的一个特质。显然这个特质并非是我们的身体力量，实际上与我们体型差不多的动物在和我们一对一的肢体交锋中都能决定性的毁灭我们。这个特质也不会是使用工具等能力，因为会使用工具不仅仅是人类。

> 📒 **prowess**: someone's prowess is their great skill at doing something; bravely in battle. 杰出的技能；英勇，勇敢。

We were able to rise the power because of a specific development in the cerebral cortex. That of abstract thought, the ability to conceptualize, predict and plan for the future. Unlike any other animal, human beings weren't just concerned with what they were going to eat today, but also what they were going to eat tomorrow, and weeks from now and years from now.

我们能够成为主导物种是因为大脑皮层的一种特殊发展让我们拥有了抽象的能力，这个能力让我们能概念化、预测和计划未来。不像其他动物，人类不仅关心他们今天要吃什么，也会关心明天吃什么，几周后吃什么，几年后吃什么。

> 📒 **cerebral cortex**: 大脑皮层（解剖）。

It was this instinct of future preservation that allowed us to ration our food, start to predict changes in seasons. We became the only animal in the history that was able to consciously forego present pleasure, in order to pave the way for a better future.

就是这种为未来而储备的本能让我们可以定量配给食物，开始预测季节的变化。我们成为了历史上唯一可以持续放弃眼前的享乐，而为更好的未来铺路的动物。

> 📒 **instinct**:
>
> - is the natural tendency that a person or animal has to behave or react in a particular way. 本能。
> - If you have an instinct for something, you are naturally good at it or able to do it. 天分。

> 📒 **ration**:
>
> - when something is rationed by a person or government, you are only allowed to have a limited of it, usually because there is not enough of it. 定量配给。

> 📒 **forego**: 放弃（正式）。**pave**: 铺砌，创造条件。

And while this trait was perhaps the single greatest survival mechanism we ever developed. I'd also argue it's the very reason why it's so difficult to be happy. Because the world is modernized, technology advanced so much faster than we did as humans. We live in this super advanced world, yet we're still packing around primal hardware, it's in our very natural to be constantly fantasizing about an ideal future. We'll work jobs that we don't like, grind away today, so that will eventually achieve prosperity tomorrow. Maybe if you're a student, you're grinding through school today, so you can eventually get the degree, get a well-paying job, maybe find the love of your life.

不过就如这个特质也许是我们人类发展出来的一个最伟大的生存机制，我还是主张它是我们难以获得幸福的最重要的原因。因为如今世界是现代化的，科技发展速度远超我们人类进化的速度。我们生活在这个极为先进的世界，但是我们的硬件设施却还是非常原始，持续幻想一个理想的未来几乎是我们的本能。我们会做自己不喜欢的工作，熬过今天，最终成就繁荣的明天。或许如果你是个学生，你今天在学校努力了一整天，这让你最后能拿到学位，找到一个高薪的工作，也可能找到你生命的另一半。

> 📒 **grind**: if you refer to routine tasks or activities as the grind, you mean they are boring and take up a lot of time and effort. 消磨。grind away: 努力工作、学习 or 熬？
>
> 📒 **prosperity**: is a condition in which a person or community is doing well financially. 繁荣。

Human beings are really good at postulating what might be in the future, and using the present to prepare for that moment. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's an extremely useful thing, it's a very motivating thing, we need to have some sort of goal and direction in our life otherwise we're completely goalless and directionless.

人类非常擅长设想未来会出现什么，然后用当下来做准备。我没有说这有什么不好，这是非常好的，也是非常激励的，在人生中我们需要一些目标和方向，否则我们就是完全的无头苍蝇。

> 📒 **postulate**:
>
> - if you postulate something, you suggest it as the basis for a theory, argument, or calculation, or assume that it is the basis. 假定。

I mean, sometimes it's kind of weird being human because not only do we exist in the present moment and have to do our day to day things, or duties and responsibilities, but we also psychologically exist at the exact same time in this abstract future, in this abstract potential, that we ourselves generated. And a lot of the time it's this abstraction that motivates us to get through our present, especially if our present is something that we don't generally like to interacting with.

我是说有时人类是奇怪的，因为我们不止活在当下，去做着我们每天必须做的事，或者义务和责任，在心理上我们还活在我们自己想象出来的抽象的未来、抽象的潜力中。并且大部分时间中，这个抽象本身激励着我们走过我们的当下，尤其是当我们的当下并非我们想要的时候。

> 📒 **psychologically**: in a way that relates to the human mind and feelings. 心理上，心理学地。
